    league_ids=[9, 13, 20, 11, 16],  # Big 5 European leagues
    gender="M",
    max_results=5
)

# Get league information
league_names = request.get_league_names()  # ['Premier League', 'La Liga', ...]
countries = request.get_countries()        # ['England', 'Spain', ...]
continents = request.get_continents()      # ['Europe']
```

request = SimilarityRequest(
    reference_player_id="player123",
    league_ids=[9, 26, 28],  # Premier League, MLS, Brasileirão
    gender="M"
)

# This will search in Europe, North America, and South America
```
